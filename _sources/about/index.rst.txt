About
#####

``dcmri`` is a Python toolbox containing a collection of functions for
DCE-MRI and DSC-MRI.

The ``dcmri`` package structure and logic follows the
`lexicon <https://osipi.github.io/OSIPI_CAPLEX/>`_ defined by the Open Source
Initiative for Perfusion Imaging `OSIPI <https://osipi.github.io/>`_, an
initiative of the perfusion study group of the International Society for
Magnetic Resonance in Medicine `ISMRM <https://www.ismrm.org>`_.,
and wraps around selected implementations collected in the
`code contributions <https://github.com/OSIPI/DCE-DSC-MRI_CodeCollection>`_
of OSIPI.

Scope
^^^^^

`dcmri` is developed in public, however it is a work in progress and not yet
sufficiently stable for wider use.
